    #### Setting Proxy Environment variables ####
    ## To set proxy env vars for the duration of playbook run, uncomment below block and set as necessary

    #### SASL Authentication Configuration ####
    ## By default there will be no SASL Authentication
    ## For SASL/PLAIN uncomment this line:
   #sasl_protocol: plain
    ## For SASL/SCRAM uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: scram
    ## For SASL/GSSAPI uncomment this line and see Kerberos Configuration properties below
    # sasl_protocol: kerberos
   
    #### Kerberos Configuration ####
    ## Applicable when sasl_protocol is kerberos
    # kerberos_kafka_broker_primary: <Name of the primary set on the kafka brokers' principal eg. kafka>
    ## REQUIRED: Under each host set keytab file path and principal name, see below
    # kerberos_configure: <Boolean for ansible to install kerberos packages and configure this file: /etc/krb5.conf, defaults to true>
    # kerberos:
    #   realm: <KDC server realm eg. confluent.example.com>
    #   kdc_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>
    #   admin_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>
    security_mode: ssl
    #### TLS Configuration ####
    ## By default, data will NOT be encrypted. To turn on TLS encryption, uncomment this line
    ssl_enabled: true
    ## By default, the components will be configured with One-Way TLS, to turn on TLS mutual auth, uncomment this line:
    ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    ## By default, the certs for this configuration will be self signed, to deploy custom certificates there are two options.
    ## Option 1: Custom Certs
    ## You will need to provide the path to the Certificate Authority Cert used to sign each hosts' certs
    ## As well as the signed certificate path and the key for that certificate for each host.
    ## These will need to be set for the correct host
    #ssl_custom_certs: true
    #ssl_ca_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/ca-cert"
    #ssl_signed_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/cert-signed"
    #ssl_key_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-key.pem"
    #ssl_key_password: <password for key fo
    ## Option 2: Custom Keystores and Truststores
    ## CP-Ansible can move keystores/truststores to their corresponding hosts and configure the components to use them. Set These vars
    ssl_provided_keystore_and_truststore: true
    ssl_keystore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/kafka.server.keystore.jks"
    ssl_keystore_key_password: serversecret
    ssl_keystore_store_password: serversecret
    ssl_truststore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/kafka.server.truststore.jks"
    ssl_truststore_password: serversecret
    ssl_truststore_ca_cert_alias: CARoot
    #### Certificate Regeneration ####
    ## When using self signed certificates, each playbook run will regenerate the CA, to turn this off, uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_ca: false
    ## By default, if keystore/truststore files exists for a component, the playbook will not recreate them
    ## To recreate the keystores and truststores uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_keystore_and_truststore: true

    #### Monitoring Configuration ####
    ## Jolokia is enabled by default. The Jolokia jar gets pulled from the internet and enabled on all the components
    ## If you plan to use the upgrade playbooks, it is recommended to leave jolokia enabled because kafka broker health checks depend on jolokias metrics
    ## To disable, uncomment this line:
    # jolokia_enabled: false
    ## During setup, the hosts will download the jolokia agent jar from Maven. To update that jar download set this var
    # jolokia_jar_url: http://<inteneral-server>/jolokia-jvm-1.6.2-agent.jar
    ## JMX Exporter is disabled by default. When enabled, JMX Exporter jar will be pulled from the Internet and enabled on the broker *only*.
    ## To enable, uncomment this line:
    # jmxexporter_enabled: true
    ## To update that jar download set this var
    # jmxexporter_jar_url: http://<internal-server>/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar

    #### Custom Yum Repo File (Rhel/Centos) ####
    ## If you are using your own yum repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_yum_repofile: true
    # custom_yum_repofile_filepath: /tmp/my-repo.repo

    #### Custom Apt Repo File (Ubuntu/Debian) ####
    ## If you are using your own apt repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_apt_repo: true
    # custom_apt_repo_filepath: "/tmp/my-source.list"

    #### Confluent Server vs Confluent Kafka ####
    ## Confluent Server will be installed by default, to install confluent-kafka instead, uncomment the below
    # confluent_server_enabled: false

    #### Schema Validation ####
    ## Schema Validation with the kafka configuration is disabled by default. To enable uncomment this line:
    ## Schema Validation only works with confluent_server_enabled: true
    # kafka_broker_schema_validation_enabled: true

    #### Fips Security ####
    ## To enable Fips for added security, uncomment the below line.
    ## Fips only works with ssl_enabled: true and confluent_server_enabled: true
    # fips_enabled: true

    #### Configuring Multiple Listeners ####
    ## CP-Ansible will configure two listeners on the broker: an internal listener for the broker to communicate and an external for the components and other clients.
    ## If you only need one listener uncomment this line:
    # kafka_broker_configure_additional_brokers: false
    ## By default both of these listeners will follow whatever you set for ssl_enabled and sasl_protocol.
    ## To configure different security settings on the internal and external listeners set the following variables:
    #wkafka_broker_custom_listeners:
    #   broker:
    #     name: BROKER
    #     port: 9091
    #     ssl_enabled: false
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: none
    #   internal:
    #     name: INTERNAL
    #     port: 9092
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: scram
    ## You can even add additional listeners, make sure name and port are unique
       # client_listener:
        #  name: CLIENT
         # port: 9094
          #ssl_enabled: false
         # ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
         # sasl_protocol: plain

    #### Creating Connectors ####
    ## To manage the connector configs from Ansible, set the following list of connector objects:
    ## one per connector, must have `name` and `config` properties
    ## make sure to provide the numeric values as strings
    # kafka_connect_connectors:
    #   - name: sample-connector
    #     config:
    #       connector.class: "FileStreamSinkConnector"
    #       tasks.max: "1"
    #       file: "path/to/file.txt"
    #       topics: "test_topic"

    #### Configuring Role Based Access Control ####
    ## To have CP-Ansible configure Components for RBAC and create necessary role bindings, set these Mandtory variables:
    ## Note: Confluent Components will be configured to connect to the "internal" listener automatically
    ## DO NOT UPDATE the internal listener
    ## Note: It is recommended to create an additional listener for external clients, but the interbroker one would also work
    ## Note: An authentication mode must be selected on all listeners, for example (ssl_enabled=false and ssl_mutual_auth_enabled=false) or sasl_protocol=none is not supported.
    # rbac_enabled: true
    ##
    ## LDAP Users
    ## Note: Below users must already exist in your LDAP environment.  See kafka_broker vars, for LDAP connection details.
    # mds_super_user: <Your mds super user which has the ability to bootstrap RBAC roles and permissions>
    # mds_super_user_password: <ldap password>
    # schema_registry_ldap_user: <Your Schema Registry username in LDAP>

    # control_center_ldap_password: <Your Control Center password in LDAP>
    ## Below are optional variables
    # create_mds_certs: false # To provide your own MDS Certs set this variable and the next two
    # token_services_public_pem_file: /path/to/public.pem
    # token_services_private_pem_file: /path/to/tokenKeypair.pem
    # mds_acls_enabled: false #to turn off mds based acls, they are on by default if rbac is on
    # mds_ssl_enabled: true/false #defaults to whatever ssl_enabled var is set to
    # mds_ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true/false #defaults to whatever ssl_mutual_auth_enabled var is set to
    ## Allow the playbooks to configure additional users as system admins on the platform, set the list below
    # rbac_component_additional_system_admins:
    #   - user1
    #   - user2


    ## To set custom properties for each service
    ## Find property options in the Confluent Documentation

      ## By default the first host will get zookeeper id=1, second gets id=2. Set zookeeper_id to customize
      # zookeeper_id: 2

      ## For kerberos sasl protocol, EACH host will need these two variables:
      # zookeeper_kerberos_keytab_path: <The path on ansible host to keytab file, eg. /tmp/keytabs/zookeeper-ip-172-31-34-246.us-east-2.compute.internal.keytab>
